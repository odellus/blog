title: Vegan Chikn and Sausage Gumbo
---

# I make vegan gumbo. There are strange rules about adding impossible sausage.

## Step 1 - Make a Roux
First step is to make a roux. I make a bunch beforehand and keep it in the fridge using this [recipe](https://laurenfromscratch.com/oven-roux/) except I do 4 cups of roux
at a time which takes a good 5-6 hours of stirring the roux every 20-30 minutes. Be extremely careful. Handling a casserole dish full of molten roux can be hazardous to your 
health. 

Seriously though make a bunch because it's a pain in the ass and don't stop before the roux is good and dark. Hell you might want it darker than I do. If you do 4 cups at 350
in the oven it takes a long ass time, but it's well worth it because you're going to be eating the best fucking soup in the world.

I store it in a big mason jar in the fridge because it's oil and flour and the roux you buy at the store comes in glass so yeah I didn't want to use a plastic container. You might
not want to either. Big case of mason jars is cheap at walmart. I had a bunch in my trunk from riding around Texas with ounces of weed (those things are the truth at locking in weed smell).

## Step 2 - Vegetables
- 3-5 stalks celery
- 1 large bell pepper (use green, everyone uses green, it's supposed to be green)
- 1 large onion
- a bunch of garlic (I am not precise with my garlic and neither should you be, if you're wondering how much to add, the answer is a lot/heaping spoonful. or two. or three. your call.)

Add the veggies in the bottom of a pot with 1/2 to 5/8 cups of roux. I'm generous with the roux because it's half the flavor so if it's a bit more than 1/2 a cup roux to 6 cups broth you'll survive.

I do more celery than every recipe calls for when adding celery, bell pepper, and onion because celery is fantastic to cook with. I despise it raw, but damn it if it isn't tasty as hell cooked.

Fry veggies in roux over medium heat for 10 minutes or so, stirring constantly. Lot of people suggest 5 minutes on higher heat, but they're wrong. This is a mirepoix-ish dish.


## Step 3 - Soup It!
While you're stirring, boil 6 cups of water in a separate pot. You can do this in a big bowl in the microwave too that works pretty well tbh. I use chipotle better than bouillon but feel
free to experiment and use whatever broth base you prefer.

Add broth to roux and veggies and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for approximately one hour. If you turn temp too low, you'll have to wait longer than an hour but
no worries. Try to start making gumbo long before you're hungry.

I have seen recpies that call for kidney beans, mushrooms, corn, tomatoes, all kinds of shit people put in a vegan gumbo. I am not telling you to do that.
I'm not telling you not to do that, but actually I am. Do not do that shit. That shit ain't fucking gumbo.

Here's what I put in my gumbo
- Roux
- soup vegetables (celery, capsicum, onion, garlic)
- Okra
- Dare chikn
- Impossible sausage (strange rules to follow)

After your gumbo has cooked for an hour or so, feel free to add okra, which are delicious. Cook for another 15-20 minutes.


# Step 4 - Meats!!! Strange Rules!!!
I put a bag of those frozen daring chikn pieces in the air fryer for like 10 minutes after tossing them in cayenne, Tony's, black pepper, garlic powder, and veg oil.
I usually put them in the soup around the same time as the okra (which is optional) after chopping them up a bit.
**Note**
They're kind of weird and gross but you know what so is normal non-vegan chicken so it fits. It's chikn sausage gumbo veganized.
If they're too weird/bad, cut em up smaller. Cook them for longer. Try other non-breaded frozen vegan chikn varieties. I like 'em.

Impossible sausage: You have to use the link kind. I asked Andrea, who is from Orange, TX, whether we could use the ground impossible sausage I turn into taco meat and she said no.
So use impossible sausage links. 

- Cover in a bit of oil and do in air fryer at 390 for like 10-12 minutes
- Allow to cool and slice into thin coins
- Throw coins back in the air fryer for 2-3 minutes
- DO NOT ADD TO SOUP UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE SERVING

If you don't cook the everloving fuck out of the impossible links or try to add them as the soup is still cooking they're going to fall apart and you're going to have a mess
on your hands. #WordToTheWise

# Conclusion
Serve over rice. Andrea loves it with potato salad (which I don't eat because I hate mayo). You don't need file powder unless you really want it authentico. They only add
as a thickener because once you've toasted the hell out of the flour it doesn't have any thickening ability anymore. You can garnish with parsely or green onion but I never bother.

You can absolutely make larger servings to meal prep but it's really best day-of and you already meal prepped when you made a bunch of roux.

Another note: once you make a bowl do not be surprised if you're eating watery rice bowl because that's what this thing is. It's a rice bowl masquerading as a soup.

Last note: put on some Hank Williams Sr because if you're not thinking "son of a gun we'll have big fun on they bayou" at least once or twice an hour when making this you're doing it wrong.
Might as well add fucking tomatoes or kidney beans (jesus fucking christ).
