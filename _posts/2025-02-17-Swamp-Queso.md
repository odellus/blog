### Instructions

Put a slicer attachment on your food processor, chop the vegetables so they'll fit in it, and slice them up. You can do it by hand if you don't have a food processor but they're like $20 at walmart and you don't have to spend time slicing vegetables. Go get a food processor.  

Throw the vegetables into the pressure cooker along with Tony's, black pepper, cumin, veg oil, and about half a cup of water. The vegetables do not need to be covered by the water we're cooking with steam.  

Cover and set time to pressure cook for 30 minutes. While that's happening you can slice cheese into cubes roughly 1" per side. If you're lazy with this it'll take longer for queso to melt.  

I used to put way too much water in there because the original recipe calls to basically boil off the water as the vegetables cook down but since we use a pressure cooker we only need half a cup of water en toto. There's a lot of water in the veggies. You shouldn't need to add more than just the half cup at the bottom so it doesn't burn.

Add the cheese to the vegetables immediately after fast release and stir constantly while it cools down from pressure cooking. Or just wait a minute if you're not hungry (I rarely make this when I'm not already very hungry).

Leave it on slow cook for however long it takes for it to melt and mix (30 or so minutes). If you can't wait and it's already mixed up pretty well just scoop out a bowl and put it in the microwave.

Bon apetite!
