Okay so I made the most amazing queso the other day and you guys have to know about it. Here's the recipe.

### Ingredients
- 2 lbs velveeta cheese
- 3 stalks celery (5 if using celery hearts)
- 1 large white onion
- 1 capsicum
- 1 jalapeno
- big spoon of minced garlic
- cumin
- Tony Chachere seasoning
- black pepper
- vegetable oil
- 2 cups water
  
### Instructions
Put a slicer attachment on your food processor, chop the vegetables so they'll fit in it, and slice them up. You can do it by hand if you don't have a food processor but they're like $20 at walmart and you don't have to spend time slicing vegetables. Go get a food processor.  

Throw the vegetables into the pressure cooker along with Tony's, black pepper, cumin, veg oil, and about a cup of water. The vegetables do not need to be covered by the water we're cooking with steam.  

Cover and set time to pressure cook for 5 minutes. While that's happening you can slice cheese into cubes roughly 1" per side. If you're lazy with this it'll take longer for queso to melt.  

Release and boil off remaining water with sautee function roughly 30-40 minutes depending on how much water you added. This is really important as you want to control how much liquid is in your queso.


Add the second cup of water and the cheese to the vegetables after they've cooled down a bit and set on slow cook for however long it takes for it to melt and mix (30 or so minutes). If you can't wait and it's already mixed up pretty well just scoop out a bowl and put it in the microwave. I always do.



Bon apetite!
