So I have some links I wanted to save and I don't use twitter to keep track of them for many reasons, so I'm going to list them below:

- [MiT OCW lecture notes on nuclear reactor physics](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/nuclear-engineering/22-05-neutron-science-and-reactor-physics-fall-2009/lecture-notes/)
- [Rutgers University physics grad course on applied group theory](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/grad/618/lects.shtml)
- [Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine](https://www.springer.com/journal/13770)
