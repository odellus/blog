# The Left's Complicated Relationship with Technology: Revolution, Reaction, and Reconstruction


## Introduction: Beyond Simple Narratives

Humans are technology monkeys. Transhumanism is a redundant ideology - merely humanism that isn't idiotic about our relationship with technology. Fire is what made us human. Metal and steam and silicon are what make humanity human. We are gods in development.

The American left's relationship with technology demands to be understood through the lens of technological determinism - not as some apologetic compromise, but as the fundamental material reality that shapes our political possibilities. The productive forces of society determine its relations of production, and technology is the primary driver of those productive forces. This isn't merely academic Marxism; it's the bedrock of any serious leftist analysis.

By technological determinism, I mean specifically that material productive capacities establish the boundaries of political and social possibility. This doesn't imply technological autonomy detached from human agency, but rather that technological development creates the necessary (though not sufficient) conditions for social transformation.

What's often portrayed as anti-technology sentiment on the left actually represents a contradiction between material reality and ideological fantasy - between what technology makes possible and what our political economy permits. The left's failure isn't in being too skeptical of technology but in failing to recognize that technological development is the prerequisite for any meaningful socialist future.

## Technological Development Through America's Reconstructions

America's history has been defined by a series of reconstructions - revolutionary periods when the nation attempted to restructure its social, economic, and racial hierarchies. Each reconstruction was fundamentally shaped by the technological capacities of its era, and each was ultimately undermined by the persistence of America's racial caste system when those technologies weren't fully democratized.

### First Reconstruction: Freedom's Brief Technological Promise

Following the Civil War, America's First Reconstruction (1865-1877) represented a fundamental rupture in the nation's productive relations. The technological determinism here couldn't be clearer: industrialization made slavery economically obsolete in the North while creating the military capacity to defeat the agrarian South. This wasn't moral evolution but material transformation - the means of production reshaping the relations of production exactly as Marx predicted.

Newly freed Black Americans understood this instinctively, establishing independent farming communities and skilled trade associations that attempted to harness industrial-age technologies. The Freedmen's Bureau briefly created mechanisms for technology transfer to formerly enslaved people - recognizing that political freedom without technological access was an empty promise.

Black inventors like Lewis Latimer (electric lighting), Granville Woods (telegraph and railroad innovations), and Elijah McCoy (industrial lubrication) made significant contributions despite overwhelming barriers. Their work wasn't peripheral but central to America's technological development, challenging the white supremacist myth that technological progress was exclusively European.

But as Reconstruction was violently overthrown, technological apartheid became explicit policy. When electricity, indoor plumbing, and telephone service reached white communities decades before Black neighborhoods, this wasn't market inefficiency but deliberate design - technology deployed as a mechanism for reinforcing racial hierarchy.

### Second Reconstruction: The New Deal's Technological Apartheid

The Second Reconstruction - the New Deal era - massively expanded technological capacity through public investment while reproducing America's racial caste system. This wasn't contradiction but coherence: the expansion of white material prosperity required the continued exploitation of Black labor.

The Tennessee Valley Authority electrified the rural South while systematically excluding Black communities. The Federal Housing Administration revolutionized homeownership through redlining that explicitly created white suburbs and Black ghettos. Social Security excluded agricultural and domestic workers by design rather than oversight. The technological expansion of American prosperity was built on technological apartheid - a system that provided material benefits for white workers while maintaining racial hierarchy.

That supposedly "golden age" of public science - from the Manhattan Project to the Apollo Program - existed within this technological apartheid. Katherine Johnson calculated flight trajectories for NASA while using "colored" restrooms. The technological achievements weren't despite racial hierarchy but entangled with it - public investment democratized for white America while systematically excluding Black Americans.

### Third Reconstruction: Civil Rights and the Powell Counteroffensive

The Third Reconstruction - the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s - directly challenged technological apartheid as activists demanded equal access to the material benefits of modernity. This wasn't mere symbolism but materialist praxis - fighting for the technological foundations of genuine equality.

The movement's victories were real but incomplete. As legal segregation fell, new mechanisms of exclusion emerged. It's no coincidence that the Powell Memo of 1971 - the blueprint for corporate America's capture of academic institutions and technological development - came just after the Civil Rights Act. As explicit segregation became untenable, capital developed new strategies to maintain hierarchies through privatization and market mechanisms.

The subsequent Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 ensured technological development would primarily benefit corporate interests rather than address community needs. Universities that had barely begun integrating were simultaneously reoriented toward profit maximization rather than public service. The timing wasn't accidental but strategic - a deliberate counter-revolution against the Third Reconstruction's promise of genuine democratization.

During this neoliberal interregnum, technology development bifurcated. Military and surveillance technologies received massive public investment, and this was no accident. The denial of basic economic rights - healthcare, housing, education - functioned as recruitment tools for the military. Imperialism and neoliberalism formed a coherent system: no Medicare for All, no housing guarantee, no dental care - because these deprivations drive enlistment in America's professional military. The technological gap between military and civilian infrastructure widened dramatically, with Pentagon budgets funding cutting-edge innovations while public infrastructure crumbled.

### Fourth Reconstruction: Biden's Technological Realignment

The emergence of what some have termed America's Fourth Reconstruction under the Biden administration represents the first significant challenge to neoliberalism's technological apartheid. Through industrial policy initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act, CHIPS Act, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the administration has attempted to reshape technological development toward public purposes - albeit within capitalist parameters.

Perhaps most significantly, the tight labor market of 2021-2023 dramatically reduced racial wage gaps, demonstrating how macroeconomic conditions can address technological disparities through material means. The labor shortage created economic conditions that accelerated racial economic equality in ways that complement and strengthen class-based civil rights struggles. This isn't sentiment but material reality - hot labor markets fundamentally alter power relations, forcing capital to pay more and reducing discriminatory hiring practices that perpetuate technological apartheid. This material success shows how anti-racist objectives are most effectively achieved when integrated with broad economic policies that shift power toward workers collectively.

When Amazon workers successfully unionized in Staten Island and tech workers organized at Google, Microsoft, and Apple, the relationship between labor power and technological development became newly visible. The Fourth Reconstruction doesn't reject technological development but attempts to redirect its benefits - a project that remains incomplete and contradictory but represents the first serious challenge to neoliberal technological apartheid.

## The Left's Technological Factions

The contemporary left's engagement with technology reflects multiple traditions that frequently contradict the fundamental materialist understanding of history. These divisions reveal not just tactical disagreements but profound theoretical confusion about technology's role in historical development.

### The Neoluddite Tradition: Technology as Domination

A significant strand of leftist thought approaches technology with deep skepticism, viewing technological systems as inherently aligned with capital accumulation and social control. Drawing on thinkers from Lewis Mumford to Langdon Winner, this tradition emphasizes how technologies embody specific power relationships under capitalism.

Contemporary theorists like Evgeny Morozov warn against "technological solutionism" â€“ the belief that complex social problems can be solved through technological fixes rather than addressing underlying power structures. Similarly, Shoshana Zuboff's critique of surveillance capitalism identifies how digital technologies create unprecedented mechanisms for behavioral manipulation and social control.

What's crucial to understand is that this perspective fundamentally misunderstands the material basis of historical development. By treating technology as secondary to political economy rather than its driving force, neoluddites invert the actual relationship between productive forces and social relations. When Amazon warehouse workers organize against algorithmic management systems, the neoluddite analysis often slides from critiquing specific deployments to rejecting technological development altogether.

Most significantly, despite their critique of capitalism, neoluddites frequently support intellectual property regimes that restrict technology diffusion. Their concerns about corporate control lead them to embrace copyright protections and patents as defensive mechanisms against exploitation â€“ failing to recognize how these very mechanisms create the distributional crisis they criticize. This contradiction stems from prioritizing defensive protection over technological advancement.

### The Accelerationist Position: Embracing Technological Determinism

In sharp contrast, left accelerationists correctly recognize that technological development fundamentally drives historical change. Writers like Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams contend that leftists should "build an intellectual infrastructure capable of thinking post-capitalism" through advanced technological systems rather than retreating to localist or primitivist fantasies.

This approach sees automation not as threat but potential liberation â€“ if its benefits can be widely distributed rather than captured by capital. Universal basic income, reduced working hours, and public ownership of automated production could transform technological efficiency from mechanism of exploitation to foundation for expanded freedom.

The accelerationist perspective recognizes the fundamental Marxist insight that you cannot build socialism without the material abundance that advanced technology makes possible. When capital increases labor productivity through technology, the left's response shouldn't be to smash the machines but to seize them â€“ to redirect technological development toward human flourishing rather than profit maximization.

The water mill gave us society with the feudal lord; the steam engine gave us society with the industrial capitalist; advanced automation and artificial intelligence will give us society with fully automated luxury communism. This isn't technological utopianism but materialist analysis â€“ recognizing that technological development creates the material conditions that make new social relations possible and ultimately inevitable.

The distributional concerns that critics raise â€“ about who benefits from technological change â€“ are real but secondary to the fundamental transformation of productive capacity. The accelerationist position doesn't neglect these concerns but properly understands them as political questions to be resolved through class struggle rather than reasons to reject technological advancement itself.

### The Appropriate Technology Movement: Petit Bourgeois Fantasy

Between these poles stands the appropriate technology movement, which focuses on matching technological systems to human scale and ecological needs. Rooted in E.F. Schumacher's concept of "small is beautiful," this tradition emphasizes technologies that communities can control and adapt to local conditions.

But this approach, despite its progressive veneer, fundamentally embodies the libertarian infection within leftist thought. When the Green New Deal promotes distributed renewable energy rather than centralized nuclear plants, it's often not making a rational technological assessment but indulging in libertarian fantasies of local control that cannot possibly scale to meet our civilizational challenges.

The appropriate technology movement represents not just a tactical disagreement but a fundamental rejection of technological determinism in favor of romantic localism. Building a post-scarcity society requires massive technological deployment at scale â€“ not small-is-beautiful solutions that cannot possibly feed, house, and care for billions of people.

This isn't to say all local technology is inherently flawed â€“ but rather that the fetishization of smallness and decentralization often functions as sabotage of necessary large-scale technological development. The French Messmer Plan of the 1970s demonstrates that centralized technological development can achieve environmental goals far more effectively than distributed approaches â€“ a fact that makes many on the left uncomfortable precisely because it challenges their libertarian assumptions about scale and control.

## The IP Contradiction: Why Technology Must Be Free to Determine

The intellectual property regime represents perhaps the most significant contradiction in leftist technology politics. IP restrictions create artificial scarcity in what should be infinitely reproducible knowledge, generating the very distributional crises that drive leftist technology skepticism.

When progressives criticize pharmaceutical companies for patent monopolies on life-saving drugs, they're identifying a genuine distributional problem. But the solution isn't stronger public interest provisions within the patent system â€“ it's recognizing that technological advancement requires the free flow of knowledge that IP inherently restricts.

The historical evidence is clear: technological development accelerates when knowledge flows freely and stagnates when enclosed. The semiconductor revolution occurred largely because early transistor technology wasn't heavily patented. The internet flourished because TCP/IP protocols remained open. Linux powers most of the world's servers because its code remains free and open source.

This creates a fundamental dilemma for leftists concerned about technology's social impacts. Intellectual property restrictions create distributional inequalities in technological benefits â€“ but these same restrictions are championed by many progressives as protective mechanisms against corporate exploitation. This contradiction stems from failing to recognize that technological determinism requires technological freedom.

The materialist analysis is straightforward: intellectual property functions primarily as sabotage in Veblen's sense â€“ deliberate restriction of productive capacity to maintain pricing power. When pharmaceutical companies leave life-saving medications unproduced in developing countries despite minimal marginal costs, they're not solving an innovation problem but engaging in deliberate sabotage to maintain artificial scarcity.

## Beyond Libertarian Confusion: Embracing Revolutionary Scale

A significant complication in leftist technology debates is the unacknowledged influence of libertarian thinking, particularly within progressive technology circles. Despite superficial opposition to libertarian politics, many left-leaning technologists have internalized key libertarian assumptions about individual autonomy, technological scale, and skepticism toward collective governance.

This manifests in contradictory positions. Some progressive technologists will simultaneously critique corporate surveillance while championing cryptocurrency systems that entrench wealth inequality. Others condemn Amazon's labor practices while celebrating the "disruption" of regulatory systems designed to protect workers. Many criticize Mark Zuckerberg personally while embracing his technological determinism philosophically â€“ but only when it serves their individualistic politics.

The libertarian confusion becomes particularly visible in debates about technological scale. Many on the left instinctively prefer distributed, individualized solutions (rooftop solar, personal fabrication) over collective infrastructure (utility-scale renewable energy, public manufacturing). This preference reflects not just democratic impulses but unconscious absorption of libertarian individualism and skepticism toward collective solutions.

This isn't just academic confusion but material sabotage. When progressives oppose nuclear power while claiming to fight climate change, they're not making a rational assessment but indulging in petit bourgeois fantasies that cannot possibly scale to decarbonize global energy systems. The French Messmer Plan of the 1970s demonstrates that large-scale collective infrastructure can achieve environmental goals far more effectively than individualized solutions.

The revolutionary position recognizes that scale itself isn't the problem â€“ it's who controls that scale and for what purpose. Massive technological systems aren't inherently oppressive if democratically controlled and directed toward human flourishing rather than profit maximization. The climate crisis demands technological solutions at planetary scale â€“ not distributed tinkering that fetishizes locality over effectiveness.

## Resolving the Contradiction: Determinism and Democratic Agency

One of the central tensions in technological determinism is the apparent contradiction between technology determining social relations and our ability to direct technological development. This isn't actually contradictory when properly understood. Technology determines the boundaries of possibility while human agency shapes which possibilities are realized.

Consider nuclear technology. Its development made possible both unprecedented energy abundance and unprecedented destruction. The technology determined that these possibilities existed, but political struggle determined which would predominate. The relative peace of the Cold War wasn't inevitable but the product of political movements that prevented nuclear annihilation.

Similarly, automation technology determines that human labor can be dramatically reduced, but class struggle determines whether this creates leisure for workers or unemployment and precarity. The issue isn't technological determinism itself but which class controls the technological development and deployment.

This reconciliation of determinism and agency requires abandoning both technological fatalism and technological voluntarism. We cannot simply wish technology to develop in ways that defy material constraints, but neither are we passive observers of autonomous technological evolution. The materialist position recognizes that technological development creates possibilities that class struggle then realizes or suppresses.

## Race, Class and Technological Access

While the essay has extensively examined technological apartheid in American history, we must also confront how race and class continue to structure technological access and development today. This isn't a secondary consideration but central to any materialist analysis of technology.

The digital divide isn't merely about who owns computers but who participates in technological production. When artificial intelligence systems are developed primarily by white and Asian men from elite educational backgrounds, the resulting technologies inevitably reflect and reproduce their creators' priorities and biases. This isn't a moral failure but a structural one - technological development shaped by existing social hierarchies.

The solution isn't diversifying the capitalist class of technology owners but democratizing technological development itself. This requires both expanded access to technical education across racial and class lines and public governance of technological direction. When technological development responds to democratic priorities rather than profit imperatives, its benefits can be equitably distributed rather than captured by a privileged minority.

The racial justice movements of recent years have correctly identified how technologies from facial recognition to algorithmic sentencing reproduce racial hierarchies. But the solution isn't abandoning these technologies but democratizing their development and governance - ensuring technological advancement serves collective flourishing rather than surveillance and control.

## Technological Determinism as Revolutionary Praxis

Moving forward requires rejecting the false choices between embracing corporate technological determinism and romantic rejection of technological systems. Instead, leftists must recognize that technological development is determinative â€“ not in the simplistic sense that technology dictates all social relations, but in the materialist understanding that technological capacity sets the boundaries of political possibility.

This means:

1. Recognizing that technology drives historical development â€“ the material forces of production shape the social relations of production
2. Understanding that technological advancement is a necessary but not sufficient condition for socialism
3. Rejecting both corporate control and individualistic localism in favor of collective technological development
4. Prioritizing technological solutions to material problems like climate change, healthcare, and poverty
5. Connecting technological development to the abolition of work â€“ automation should reduce labor time, not increase profits

The left's complicated relationship with technology ultimately reflects ideological confusion rather than principled critique. By embracing technological determinism â€“ recognizing that advanced technology is not optional but necessary for socialism â€“ we can develop a politics that directs technological development toward human flourishing rather than private profit.

In the final analysis, there is no path to socialism that doesn't run through technological advancement. The question isn't whether technology will determine our future but whether we will direct that technological development toward liberation or allow it to reinforce existing hierarchies. Anything less than a full embrace of technological determinism isn't Marxism but mysticism â€“ a retreat from material reality into ideological fantasy.

## The Distributional Crisis of Innovation Under Capitalism

The legitimate concern that unites various leftist technology perspectives is the real distributional crisis of innovation under capitalism. Technological development under private ownership consistently produces benefits that flow primarily to capital rather than labor â€“ a pattern visible from pharmaceuticals to renewable energy to digital platforms.

When life-saving medications remain inaccessible to most of humanity despite minimal production costs, when climate solutions gather dust in patent portfolios while the planet burns, when digital networks extract data from billions while concentrating wealth among a few â€“ these aren't market failures but market features. The system functions exactly as designed, transforming technological advancement into private wealth rather than public benefit.

This distributional crisis is precisely why technological determinism matters so fundamentally. If technology determines historical development, then restricting technological benefits to a privileged few constitutes not just inequality but sabotage of human potential. The artificial scarcity created by intellectual property regimes doesn't just create injustice â€“ it actively prevents the technological abundance that could make socialism materially possible.

Resolving this crisis requires not rejecting technological determinism but embracing it more fully â€“ recognizing that technological development must be liberated from capital's constraints to fulfill its revolutionary potential. The materialist position isn't that technology is neutral but that its development direction and distributional pattern are fundamentally political questions that cannot be left to market forces.

## Breakthrough: Medicare as Monopsony Instead of Moralism

A concrete example of technological determinism in practice can be found in the healthcare system. The left's traditional approach emphasizes moral appeals about healthcare as a human right â€“ a position that, while ethically sound, fails to address the material conditions that make universal healthcare possible.

The technological determinist perspective recognizes that healthcare systems are fundamentally technological assemblages shaped by material constraints. The breakthrough position isn't appealing to moral sentiments but establishing Medicare as a monopsony purchaser â€“ using collective bargaining power to force pharmaceutical companies to provide medications at reasonable prices while eliminating the artificial scarcity created by patent monopolies.

This approach doesn't reject technological innovation in medicine but liberates it from capital's constraints â€“ allowing technological development to serve human needs rather than shareholder returns. It recognizes that the problem isn't technological advancement itself but the property relations that restrict its benefits to those who can pay monopoly prices.

The same principle applies across sectors. Climate action doesn't require primitivist reduction in living standards but technological development liberated from fossil capital's sabotage. Housing affordability doesn't require abandoning modern construction techniques but deploying them at scale without rentier extraction. In each case, the solution lies not in rejecting technological determinism but in embracing it more fully â€“ recognizing that technology must be developed and deployed for collective benefit rather than private profit.

## Advancing Beyond Moralism Without Abandoning Ethics

The critique of moralism in leftist politics doesn't mean abandoning ethical considerations altogether. Rather, it recognizes that appeals to moral sentiment without material analysis lead to ineffective politics. When we argue healthcare is a human right without addressing the technological and economic systems that make universal healthcare possible, we're engaging in idealism rather than materialism.

The materialist position isn't amoral but recognizes that ethical outcomes require material foundations. Universal healthcare isn't impossible because people are selfish but because profit-driven healthcare systems create artificial scarcity. Climate justice isn't blocked by moral failure but by the material interests of fossil capital. Housing for all isn't prevented by lack of compassion but by property relations that treat housing as investment rather than human need.

By focusing on the material rather than moral, we develop more effective politics. Medicare as monopsony isn't framed as moral virtue but material power â€“ collective bargaining deployed against pharmaceutical profiteering. Public housing isn't justified through appeals to charity but through efficiency and abundance â€“ building at scale what markets cannot provide.

This isn't abandoning ethics but grounding it in material reality rather than abstract ideals. People deserve healthcare, housing, and environmental security not because of inherent rights but because we have the technological capacity to provide these things to everyone. The scandal isn't moral failure but artificial scarcity â€“ deliberately constraining technological abundance to maintain profit.

## Conclusion: Technology Determines Everything, Actually

The left's complicated relationship with technology ultimately reflects a failure to fully embrace the materialist understanding that technology determines historical development. By fetishizing distribution without equally emphasizing development, by indulging in libertarian fantasies of small-scale localism, by supporting intellectual property regimes that create artificial scarcity â€“ much of the left has abandoned technological determinism precisely when it's most needed.

The revolutionary position recognizes that technology determines everything â€“ not in a simplistic, autonomous sense, but in the fundamental understanding that material productive forces shape what's politically possible. There is no socialism without abundance, no abundance without technological development, and no technological development without challenging the property relations that restrict innovation's benefits.

This isn't techno-utopianism but materialist analysis. The distribution of technological benefits is a political question that can't be separated from technological development itself. By embracing technological determinism while fighting for democratic control of technology's direction and benefits, we can develop a politics capable of transforming society rather than merely criticizing it.

In the final analysis, there is no path to liberation that doesn't run through technological advancement. The question isn't whether technology will determine our future but whether that determination will serve the many or the few. Everything else is just mysticism.

We are technology monkeys, after all. Fire made us human. Metal and steam and silicon shaped our civilization. We are gods in development - but only if we collectively seize the technological means of our own evolution rather than allowing it to remain privatized and constrained. Transhumanism isn't a separate ideology but simply humanism that takes seriously our technological nature and potential. Our future depends not on rejecting this nature but on democratizing it.
