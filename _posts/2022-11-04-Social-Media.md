So the worst person in the world owns Twitter now, and I really need to get into blogging, not micro-blogging. My ability to write long form has suffered tremendously, though to be honest it was never that strong in the first place and micro-blogging on social media has undoubtedly been extremely beneficial for my writing abilities. Literacy isn't just being able to read. It's also being able to write, and in that regard I don't write nearly enough.

I always act like I don't have anything worth writing a long form article about, but there are so many common threads to all of my posts that I find that assertion patently absurd. I mean it seems like political economics is my passion, but it's really only because I don't get to spend enough time with my robot arms and I'm burned out as fuck from work every time I have a minute or two to myself. I'm not a machine.

One thing I noticed is that I don't feel like just constantly posting on mastodon the way I do on twitter. I'm sure I'll find atomic communist mastodon and tweet about it all the time before I know it. But for now it's pretty slow. As I understand you have to work harder to seek out content.

Okay so I deleted my twitter account. I know it won't help the problem I wish it would help fix, but I am really just not okay with being on Tesla/SpaceX social media. Nope. No. Hell no. Uh uh. I don't fucking think so.

So I have a TODO list here that I'm appending to the post on social media because this is my blog and I can do what I want.

### Robot
1. Just start playing with it
2. Work to replicate papers
3. Try new things using already existing code
4. Write it up

Because yeah I have a robot arm now and I haven't even opened the box because I don't know where I want to live. Speaking of, I think that's sort of been decided for now.
